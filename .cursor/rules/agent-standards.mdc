# Agent Standards (MUST READ)

This document is a living document, and should be updated as project standards
evolve. Our goal with this codebase is to improve the workflows of Engineering
Designers at MEP firms. These are the guiding principles of writing
maintainable, consistent, and predictable code for this purpose:

- _fail fast, fail loudly, fail early_
- _make composable systems_
- _type-safety at all costs_
- _linear execution flow, easy debugability_
- _wrap dangerous/finicky Revit API methods and classes_

In service of helping engineers we also want to write fast while maintaining
quality. With the availability of AI writing one-off code and performing
refactors is trivial. To suppor this behavior, the following codebase-management
best practices should be followed:

- _make or update.cursor rules, skills, plans_
- _update `/docs` folder when things are out of sync_
- _architect libraries for easy logging and debugging_
- _make methods specifcally for logging debug info_
- _architect and make methods for testing (e.g. an easily testable method would
  have a simpler api and few to no deps)_

## Sandbox: Testing & POC'ing & Exploring

The easiest way to test is to write a "Task" for the Task Palette. This lets us
run oneoff code to test and verify soltuions before fully implementing. Common
use cases are:

- compare the performance of different approaches to a problem
- use reflection to print all members of a class or enum
- POC/MVP a core library method
- verify/debug that a Revit API method behaves as expected

## Do's

1. Always do your research into existing patterns/solutions before writing code.
2. Follow, but also think critically about existing patterns. We want
   consistency and the (mostly) ideal solution. In the age of AI refactor effort
   is not a concern. If you see an opportunity to improve a pattern/system in a
   way that it still serves all its consumers, then suggest it.
3. Think deeply about publicly exposed API surfaces and architecture choices.
   Library code should balance the tradeoffs of being intuitive to use and
   general purpose.
4. **Always ask before building the solution.** The user will often be inside of
   a Rider debug session attached to Revit, rebuilding breaks this. If ok, then
   build to check your work if the breadth of a change is big, or if your
   expectations and LSP are at odds. Use commands that minimize output like
   `dotnet build -c "Debug.R25" -nologo -clp:NoSummary /p:WarningLevel=0`
5. Exceptions should generally be avoided, prefer the `Result<TValue>` or
   `Try...` patterns, particularly if it's part of the public API surface and/or
   may be exposed to users. using the `Result<TValue` type allows us to _return_
   errors rather than throw, which is better for perf. For both DX posterity,
   record common footguns/suggestions in error messages, for example: special
   transaction needs for RVT API methods, a method (eg.
   FamilyManager.SetFormula) throw unhelpful error messages, etc.
6. Reduce nesting in written code and stacktraces. Use method extraction or
   condition inversion to avoid nesting in written code. Prefer sequential
   execution flow with early `return`/`break`/`continue`/`throw` over nesting.
7. Type-safety do's: label/handle nullables correctly, use generics, use
   `nameof()`, us ``is` and pattern matching,
8. Use LINQ and Fluent APIs when possible.
9. Use extension methods to get commonly used finicky code out of sight.
10. Research the breath of a problem and attempt to prove it before trying to
    solve it.
11. Use Serilogs Log.<Level> rather than Console.WriteLine or Debug.WriteLine.
12. Weigh the addition of new code against the cost of maintenance and DX.
13. Apply project standards to all code. If existing code doesn't follow the
    standards, refactor it to do so. Pay close attention to nullability and
    type-safety.
14. Centralize comments into blocks rather than sprinkling them throughout.

## Don'ts 👎👎👎

1. Don't write markdown summaries unless asked!
2. Don't nest `for` loops or `if` statements more than 4 times in a single
   method.
3. Don't (or mostly avoid) using reflection, `!`, `object` or `dynamic` type, or
   cast down
4. Don't rebuild the project without asking first. _The user will often be
   inside of a Rider debug session attached to Revit, rebuilding breaks
   debugging assembly references_, forcing them to restart.
5. Don't support backward compatibility after a refactor. If you are tempted to
   add an `[Obsolete]` attribute, delete the method and update consumers. We
   want the enforce ONE way to do something. If a new way to is better, refactor
   the old to use the new.
