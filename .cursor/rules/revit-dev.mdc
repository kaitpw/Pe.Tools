# Standards

For Agents:

Always ask before building the solution. The user will often be inside of a
Rider debug session attached to Revit, rebuilding breaks this. If ok, then build
to check your work if the breadth of a change is big, or if your expectations
and LSP are at odds. Use commands that minimize output like
`dotnet build -c "Debug.R25" -nologo -clp:NoSummary /p:WarningLevel=0`
